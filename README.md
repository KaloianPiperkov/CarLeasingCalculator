# Car Leasing Calculator

The Car Leasing Calculator is a web-based application implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides users with the capability to calculate leasing costs based on selected parameters.

## Approach

The application is structured as follows:

- **HTML Structure**: Includes form elements for selecting car type (new or used), specifying car value, lease period, and down payment percentage.

- **CSS Styling**: Provides a responsive and visually appealing layout, ensuring usability across different devices and screen sizes.

- **JavaScript Logic**: Handles user interactions and calculations in real-time. Key functionalities include dynamically updating leasing cost based on selected parameters, validating user inputs for car value, lease period, and down payment percentage, and computing total leasing costs inclusive of interest rates based on the selected car type (new or used).

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures usability on both desktop and mobile devices. Desktop view presents inputs and results in a structured grid format, while mobile view organizes them into a vertical list for clarity.
